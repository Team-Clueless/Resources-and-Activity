# Major Tasks - for the whole team

- [ ] Choosing the relevant files from the resources given.
- [ ] Spawning a "dry model" of the bot without any sensors, plugins or such.
- [ ] Choosing the right sensors and plugins for the bot.
- [ ] Setting up object and lane detection models and integrating them with ROS.
- [ ] Setting up the navigation stack for the bot - the path-planners and localisation techniques.
- [ ] Finding ~or making~ a controller.  

- [ ] Going through the IGVC guide. 

### Questions to ask at tomorrow's meeting  

- Do we have to read the whole IGVC guide? What parts should we focus on?
- Which year's guide should we refer? 2019 or 2020?
- Dimensions of the bot
- Should we use URDF or SDF?
- How to go about selecting the sensors?
